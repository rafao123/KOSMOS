# KOSMOS
ðŸš€ This repository shall be used for controlling projects versions ðŸš€
The Embedded Systems department of Kosmos Rocketry Team will now adopt GitHub for versions control.
This way, multiple persons will be able to make changes amolst simultaneously and with much ease.
It may be the end of asking people for the project file and the changes they have made.

Hope it works just fine and we all enjoy it,
Cocota.
